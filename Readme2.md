## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The **Signout Launcher** schedules this script at a defined **Notification Time**.
2. When the script runs:
   - It calculates:
     - `Exact Out`: current time + 5 minutes
     - `Safe Out`: `Exact Out` + 3 minutes
   - A borderless window **fades in** and **slides up** from the bottom of your screen.
   - A subtle **system notification sound** is played.
3. The GUI remains visible for a limited time, then fades out or closes automatically.
